# Intelligence Scale

A curated collection of skills that help developers work more effectively with Claude Code. These skills enforce structured workflows for planning, execution, and verification—ensuring AI-assisted development is predictable, traceable, and high-quality.

## Philosophy

Intelligence Scale is built on the principle that AI-assisted development works best when:

1. **Plans are explicit and documented** — No guessing about what needs to be done
2. **Execution follows clear steps** — Systematic progress with checkpoints
3. **Verification is built into the workflow** — Confidence that work is complete
4. **Human oversight is preserved** — Critical decisions stay with the developer

## Use Cases

- **Project Planning**: Create comprehensive development plans before making changes. Define exact tasks, file paths, and verification criteria upfront.

- **Structured Execution**: Follow plans systematically with built-in parallelism. Execute tasks efficiently while respecting dependencies.

- **Error Recovery**: Handle failures gracefully with documented recovery procedures. Prevent goal drift when things go wrong.

- **Quality Assurance**: Audit and verify work through structured review processes. Ensure every planned change was implemented correctly.

- **Idea Exploration**: Brainstorm and refine ideas through collaborative dialogue before committing to implementation.

## Skills Included

This plugin includes 6 interconnected skills that form a complete development workflow:

1. **Brainstorming** — Explore ideas and design solutions collaboratively
2. **Write Plan** — Create structured, actionable development plans
3. **Execute Plan** — Implement plans with parallelism and verification gates
4. **Audit Plan** — Verify all planned changes were implemented correctly
5. **Recover from Errors** — Handle failures and prevent context drift
6. **Using Skills** — Meta-skill for discovering and invoking other skills
