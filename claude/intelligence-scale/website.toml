intro = """
I believe we can scale our intelligence with deterministic signals, natural language-based judgments, and skill triggers. When I tried to scale my intelligence this way, I found some limits in the current Claude Code implementation—so I designed several skills to address those issues.

The first challenge is the review burden. When executing long-running tasks, plans become too lengthy and difficult to understand. Even Claude Code might generate plans you can't fully grasp—especially when using it to explore unfamiliar territory.

Traditional plans are built for humans who imagine based on existing situations: they describe the current state and what actions will change it. But living in this context can cause hallucinations in large language models.
