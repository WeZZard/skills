intro = """
I believe we can scale our intelligence with deterministic signals, natural language-based judgments, and skill triggers. When I tried to scale my intelligence this way, I found some limits in the current Claude Code implementation—so I designed several skills to address those issues.

title = "Addressing the Review Burden"
content = """
The first challenge is the review burden. When executing long-running tasks, plans become too lengthy and difficult to understand. Even Claude Code might generate plans you can't fully grasp—especially when using it to explore unfamiliar territory.

Traditional plans are built for humans who imagine based on existing situations: they describe the current state and what actions will change it. But living in this context can cause hallucinations in large language models.
"""
highlight_title = "Why Plans Fail"
highlight_content = "Traditional plans describe state transitions for humans who imagine outcomes. LLMs living in this context hallucinate because they lack grounded state awareness."
comparison_before_label = "Traditional Plan"
comparison_before = "Describe current state → list changes → hope for the best"
comparison_after_label = "Intelligence Scale Plan"
comparison_after = "Structured template → verification gates → evidence-based execution"

[[philosophy.sections]]
title = "Polished Plan Structure"
content = """
Intelligence Scale uses a refined plan structure designed to reduce review pressure on human beings. Plans are organized with clear task dependencies, explicit verification steps, and human verification gates for subjective decisions.
"""
highlight_title = "Structured Plan Template"
highlight_content = "Plans include task dependencies, verification steps, human verification gates, and explicit file paths—reducing ambiguity and review effort."

[[philosophy.sections]]
title = "Maximizing Task Parallelism"
content = """
The latest Opus model excels at executing concurrent tasks. Intelligence Scale prompts Claude Code to maximize task parallelism whenever possible, spawning subagents for independent work while respecting task dependencies.
"""
highlight_title = "Automatic Parallelism"
highlight_content = "Every user prompt triggers a reminder to spawn subagents for independent tasks, ensuring maximum throughput without manual orchestration."

[[philosophy.sections]]
title = "Error Recovery"
content = """
While the latest Opus model has strong error resilience, recovering from errors still has common cases and edge cases that need attention. Intelligence Scale hints Claude Code to check the session plan when it encounters repeated errors, providing a structured path back to productive work.
"""
highlight_title = "Preventing Goal Drift"
highlight_content = "When tools fail, the natural instinct is to generalize or guess. Intelligence Scale forces re-alignment to the plan, preventing cascading errors."
comparison_before_label = "Without Recovery"
comparison_before = "Tool fails → guess new params → drift from goal → waste context"
comparison_after_label = "With Recovery"
comparison_after = "Tool fails → check plan → verify alignment → fix specific issue"

[[philosophy.sections]]
title = "Plan Execution Audit"
content = """
When a plan is executed, some parts might not be fully implemented. The audit-plan skill verifies plan execution compliance, measuring the gap between the existing implementation and the goals described in the plan.
"""
highlight_title = "Compliance Verification"
highlight_content = "After execution, every task is verified against the plan with evidence-based status reporting: Done, Partial, or Missing."
