      "Ground Truth First - Use web search to validate facts; don't rely on stale knowledge",
      "Verify Validity - Check source, date, and time of external info before using it",
      "Guardrails - Never present assumptions as facts; validate before concluding",
      "Explore alternatives - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling",
      "Incremental validation - Present design in sections, validate each",
      "Be flexible - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense"
