    "shortSummary": "Always invoke relevant skills before responding or acting to maintain structured, efficient workflows.",
    "fullSummary": "This foundational skill ensures you always check for applicable skills before taking any action, including asking clarifying questions. It establishes a disciplined approach where skill invocation takes priority, preventing wasted time and ensuring you follow established workflows. By checking first, you guarantee that all tasks benefit from Claude's structured processes.",

        "title": "Prevents Rationalization",
        "description": "Common thoughts like 'This is just a simple question' or 'I need more context first' are red flags that mean you should stop and check for skills. The skill provides a table of these rationalizations to help you recognize and avoid them. This discipline prevents wasted effort and ensures consistent application of best practices."

This logical sequence ensures you approach tasks methodically, from planning through execution to validation."

        "title": "Rigid vs Flexible Skills",
        "description": "Skills are categorized as rigid (must be followed exactly, like execute-plan) or flexible (principles can be adapted, like brainstorming). This distinction helps you understand when to stick strictly to the process versus when you can adjust based on context, balancing discipline with adaptability."
