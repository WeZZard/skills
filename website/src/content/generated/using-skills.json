    "shortSummary": "Always check for relevant skills before responding to ensure you follow Claude's established workflows and processes",
    "fullSummary": "This foundational skill establishes the critical rule that you must check for applicable skills before any response or action. It prevents wasted time by ensuring you follow Claude's proven workflows rather than improvising. The skill provides clear guidelines for when and how to use skills, along with common rationalizations to avoid.",

        "description": "You must invoke any potentially relevant skill before responding—even with just a 1% chance it applies. This check comes before clarifying questions, code exploration, or any other action. If a skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you can simply not use it after checking."

        "title": "Avoid Rationalization Traps",
        "description": "The skill identifies common thoughts that lead to skipping skill checks, like 'This is just a simple question' or 'I need more context first.' These rationalizations waste time and prevent you from following established workflows that would make your work more efficient and effective."

        "title": "Clear Skill Priority",
        "description": "When multiple skills could apply, follow this order: process skills first (like brainstorming), then implementation skills (like write-plan), then verification skills (like review). This ensures you approach tasks methodically rather than jumping straight to implementation."

      {
        "title": "Rigid vs Flexible Skills",
        "description": "Some skills are rigid (like execute-plan) and must be followed exactly, while others are flexible (like brainstorming) where you adapt principles to context. Each skill tells you which type it is, so you know how strictly to follow it."
